To use this playbook, you'll need to create a template file for the AppImage .desktop files. Create a file named appimage.desktop.j2 in the same directory as your playbook:

To run this playbook, you would use:
```
ansible-playbook setup_linux.yml
```
Note that you might need to adjust some paths and variables to fit your specific setup. Also, make sure you have the necessary Ansible collections installed:
```
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
```
This playbook provides a good starting point, but you might want to further customize it based on your specific needs, such as adding support for Budgie desktop or handling any special cases that were in the original script but not covered here.
